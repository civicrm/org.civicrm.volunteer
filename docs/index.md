# CiviVolunteer

## Overview

The [CiviVolunteer extension](https://github.com/civicrm/org.civicrm.volunteer.git "CiviVolunteer extension") provides tools for signing up, managing, and tracking volunteers.

### Features

* Define multiple [volunteer projects](./projects.md).
    * (Optionally) [associate a project with a CiviCRM event](./projects.md#events).
    * Define specific [volunteer opportunities](./opportunities.md) for each project with distinct roles and shifts.
* Allow volunteers to:
    * [sign up for specific opportunities](./sign-up-form.md) themselves.
    * [express interest](./interest-form.md) generally in volunteering, without signing up for anything specifically.
* Manually [assign volunteers to shifts](./assignments.md)
* [Log](/.logging-hours.md) and [report](./reporting.md) on volunteer hours

This documentation book provides assistance to users, administrators, and developers of CiviVolunteer.

* [Q&A on StackExchange](http://civicrm.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/civivolunteer) (with the `civivolunteer` tag)

## Requirements

* CiviCRM 4.4 or higher
* The [Angular Profiles](https://civicrm.org/extensions/angular-profile-utilities) extension must also be installed and enabled

## Known Issues

* Before 4.7.21, extension permissions did not work properly in Joomla! (see [CRM-12059](https://issues.civicrm.org/jira/browse/CRM-12059)). CiviCRM would recognize extension-defined permissions but not give site administrators any way to grant them to users.

## Future plans

* Going forward there are some great ideas on the drawing board for phase 2 including: specification of qualifications and skill-matching, linking volunteer opportunities directly to an organization or individual, recurring volunteer opportunities, public recognition / rewards, and self-service logging of volunteer hours.
* If your organization has a invested in a CiviCRM installation, and you foresee a need for CiviVolunteer, consider donating to the ongoing development of CiviVolunteer through the [Make it Happen program](https://civicrm.org/make-it-happen/civivolunteer-improvements).
* Developers within organizations that would like to use CiviVolunteer are more than welcome to participate in the development and testing effort.
